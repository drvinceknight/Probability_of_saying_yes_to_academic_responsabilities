Repo for blog post making use of XKCDify. I wrote some code for a [blog post](http://drvinceknight.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/probability-of-saying-yes-to-academic.html) after reading [this post](http://blogs.ams.org/phdplus/2013/05/19/learning-to-say-no/).

The main point of my post is to draw a plot in XKCD style showing the probability of saying "yes" to various academic responsibility requests.

I make use of this [github repo](https://github.com/twam/matplotlib-XKCDify) for the XKCDify part.
